## Problem

If children don't play enough with other children during the first five years of life, there is a great chance that they will have some kind of mental illness later in their lives.

## Solution

Lay out common land, paths, gardens, and bridges so that groups of at least 64 households are connected by a swath of land that does not cross traffic. Establish this land as the connected play space for the children in these households.
