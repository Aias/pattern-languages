## Problem

People are different sizes; they sit in different ways. And yet there is a tendency in modern times to make all chairs alike.

## Solution

Never furnish any place with chairs that are identically the same. Choose a variety of different chairs, some big, some small, some softer than others, some rockers, some very old, some new, with arms, without arms, some wicker, some wood, some cloth.
