## Problem

This is one of the patterns people most often disagree with. However, we believe they are mistaken.

## Solution

Give those parts of the house where people sleep, an eastern orientation, so that they wake up with the sun and light. This means, typically, that the sleeping area needs to be on the eastern side of the house; but it can also be on the western side provided there is a courtyard or a terrace to the east of it.
