## Problem

More than 90 percent of the people walking about in an ordinary neighborhood are unhealthy, judged by simple biological criteria. This ill health cannot be cured by hospitals or medicine.

## Solution

Gradually develop a network of small health centers, perhaps one per community of 7,000, across the city; each equipped to treat everyday disease—both mental and physical, in children and adults—but organized essentially around a functional emphasis on those recreational activities which keep people in good health, like swimming and dancing.
