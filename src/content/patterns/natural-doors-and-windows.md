### Problem

Finding the right position for a window or a door is a subtle matter. But there are very few ways of building which take this into consideration.

### Solution

On no account use standard doors or windows. Make each window a different size, according to its place.

Do not fix the exact position or size of the door and window frames until the rough framing of the room has actually been built, and you can really stand inside the room and judge, eye by eye, exactly where you want to put them, and how big you want them. When you decide, mark the openings with strings.

Make the windows smaller and smaller, as you go higher in the building.
