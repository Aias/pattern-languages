## Problem

Gardens and small public parks don't give enough relief from noise unless they are well-protected.

## Solution

Form some kind of enclosure to protect the interior of a quiet garden from the sights and sounds of passing traffic. IF it is a large garden or a park, the enclosure can be soft, can include bushes, trees, slopes, and so on. The smaller the garden, however, the harder and more defined the enclosure must become. In a very small garden, form the enclosure with buildings or walls; even hedges and fences will not be enough to keep out sound.
