### Problem

It has lately been assumed that people no longer want to walk to local stores. This assumption is mistaken.

### Solution

Give every neighborhood at least one corner grocery, somewhere near its heart. Place these corner groceries every 200 to 800 yards, according to the density, so that each one serves about 100 people. Place them on corners, where large numbers of people are going past. And combine them with houses, so that people who run them can live over them or next to them.
