### Problem

Somewhere in every garden, there must be at least one spot, a quiet garden seat, in which a person—or two people—can reach into themselves and be in touch with nothing else but nature.

### Solution

Make a quiet place in the garden—a private enclosure with a comfortable seat, think planting, sun. Pick the place for the sear carefully; pick the place that will give you the most intense kind of solitude.
