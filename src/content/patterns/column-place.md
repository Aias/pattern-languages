### Problem

Thin columns, spindly columns, columns which take their shape from structural arguments alone, will never make a comfortable environment.

### Solution

When a column is free standing, make it as thick as a person—at least 12 inches, preferably 16 inches: and form places around it where people can sit and lean comfortably: a step, a small seat built up against the column, or a space formed by a pair of columns.
