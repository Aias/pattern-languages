### Problem

Wherever there is action in a place, the spots which are the most inviting are those high enough to give people a vantage point, and low enough to put them in action.

### Solution

In any public place where people loiter, add a few steps at the edge where stairs come down or where there is a change of level. Make these raised areas immediately accessible from below, so that people may congregate and sit to watch the goings-on.
