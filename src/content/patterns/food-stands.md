## Problem

Many of our habits and institutions are bolstered by the fact that we can get simple, inexpensive food on the street, on the way to shopping, work, and friends.

## Solution

Concentrate food stands where cars and paths meet—either portable stands or small huts, or built into the fronts of buildings, half-open to the street.
