## Problem

Arriving in a building, or leaving it, you need a room to pass through, both inside the building and outside it. This is the entrance room.

## Solution

At the main entrance to a building, make a light-filled room which marks the entrance and straddles the boundary between indoors and outdoors, covering some space outdoors and some space indoors. The outside part may be like an old-fashioned porch; the inside like a hall or sitting room.
