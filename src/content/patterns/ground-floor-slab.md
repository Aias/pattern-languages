### Problem

The slab is the easiest, cheapest, and most natural way to lay a ground floor.

### Solution

Build a ground floor slab, raised slightly—six or nine inches above the ground—by first building a low perimeter wall around the building, tied into the column foundations, and then filling it with rubble, gravel, and concrete.
