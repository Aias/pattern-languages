### Problem

Metropolitan regions will not come to balance until each one is small and autonomous enough to be an independent sphere of culture.

### Solution

Wherever possible, work toward the evolution of independent regions in the world; each with a population between 2 and 10 million; each with its own natural and geographic boundaries; each with its own economy; each one autonomous and self-governing; each with a seat in a world government, without the intervening power of larger states or countries.
