### Problem

It is not possible to avoid the need for high-speed roads in modern society; but it is essential to place them and build them in such a way that they do not destroy communities or countryside.

### Solution

Place high-speed roads (freeways and other major arteries) so that:

1. At least one high-speed road lies tangent to each local transport area.
2. Each local transport area has a least one side not bounded by a high-speed road, but directly open to the countryside.
3. The road is always sunken, or shielded along its length by berms, or earth, or industrial buildings, to protect the nearby neighborhoods from noise.
