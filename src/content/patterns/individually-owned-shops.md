### Problem

When shops are too large, or controlled by absentee owners, they become plastic, bland, and abstract.

### Solution

Do what you can to encourage the development of individually owned shops. Approve applications for business licenses only if the business is owned by those people who actually work and manage the store. Approve new commercial building permits only if the proposed structure includes many very very small rental spaces.
