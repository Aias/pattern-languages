### Problem

Very simply—when the area devoted to parking is too great, it destroys the land.

### Solution

Do not allow more than 9 percent of the land in any given area to be used for parking. In order to prevent the "bunching" of parking in huge neglected areas, it is necessary for a town or a community to subdivide its land into "parking zones" no larger than 10 acres each and to apply the same rule in each zone.
