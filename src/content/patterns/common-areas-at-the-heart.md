## Problem

No social group—whether a family, a work group, or a school group—can survive without constant informal contact among its members.

## Solution

Create a single common area for every social group. Locate it at the center of gravity of all the spaces the group occupied, and in such a way that the paths which go in and out of the building lie tangent to it.
