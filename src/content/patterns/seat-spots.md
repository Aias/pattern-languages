## Problem

Where outdoor seats are set down without regard for view and climate, they will almost certainly be useless.

## Solution

Choosing good spots for outdoor seats is far more important than building fancy benches. Indeed, if the spot is right, the most simply kind of seat is perfect.

In cool climates, choose them to face the sun, and to be protected from the wind; in hot climates, put them in shade and open to summer breezes. In both cases, place them to face activities.
