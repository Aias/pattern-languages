## Problem

As the decentralization of work becomes more and more effective, the workshop in the home grows and grows in importance.

## Solution

Make a place in the home where substantial work can be done; not just a hobby, but a job. Change the zoning laws to encourage modest, quiet work operations to locate in neighborhoods. Give the workshop perhaps a few hundred square feet; and locate it so it can be seen from the street and the owner can hang out a shingle.
