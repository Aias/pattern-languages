## Problem

The life of a public square forms naturally around its edge. If the edge fails, then the space never becomes lively.

## Solution

Surround public gathering places with pockets of activity—small, partly enclosed areas at the edges, which jut forward into the open space between the paths, and contain activities which make it natural for people to pause and get involved.
