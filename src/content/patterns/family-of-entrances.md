## Problem

When a person arrives in a complex of offices or services or workshops, or in a group of related houses, there is a good chance they will experience confusion unless the whole collection is laid out before them, so that they can see the entrance of the place where they are going.

## Solution

Lay out the entrances to form a family. This means:

1. They form a group, are visible together, and each visible from all the others.
2. They are all broadly similar, for instances all porches, or all gates in a wall, or all marked by a similar kind of doorway.
