## Problem

When plate glass windows became possible, people thought that they would put us more directly in touch with nature. In fact, they do the opposite.

## Solution

Divide each window into small panes. These panes can be very small indeed, and should hardly ever be more than a foot square. To get the exact size of the panes, divide the width and height of the window by the number of panes. Then each window will have different sized panes according to its height and width.
