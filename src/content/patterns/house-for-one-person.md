### Problem

Once a household for one person is part of some larger group, the most critical problem which arises is the need for simplicity.

### Solution

Conceive a house for one person as a place of the utmost simplicity: essentially a one-room cottage or studio, with large and small alcoves around it. When it is most intense, the entire house may be no more than 300 to 400 square feet.
