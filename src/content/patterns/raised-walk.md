## Problem

Where fast-moving cars and pedestrians meet in cities, the cars overwhelm the pedestrians. The car is kind, and people are made to feel small.

## Solution

We conclude that any pedestrian path along a road carrying fast-moving cars should be about 18 inches above the road, with a low wall or railing, or balustrade along the edge, to mark the edge. Put the raised walk on only one side of the road—make it as wide as possible.
