### Problem

Dark, gloomy kitchens are depressing. The kitchen needs the sun more than the other rooms, not less.

### Solution

Place the main part of the kitchen counter on the south and southeast side of the kitchen, with big windows around it, so that sun can flood in and fill the kitchen with yellow light both morning and afternoon.
