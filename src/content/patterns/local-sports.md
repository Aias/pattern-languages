### Problem

The human body does not wear out with use. On the contrary, it wears down when it is not used.

### Solution

Scatter places for team and individual sports through every work community and neighborhood: tennis, squash, table tennis, swimming, billiards, basketball, dancing, gymnasium...and make the action visible to passers-by, as an invitation to participate.
