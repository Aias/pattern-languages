### Problem

People use open space if it is sunny, and do not use it if it isn't, in all but desert climates.

### Solution

Always place buildings to the north of the outdoor spaces that go with them, and keep the outdoor spaces to the south. Never leave a deep band of shade between the building and the sunny part of the outdoors.
