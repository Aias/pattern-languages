### Problem

The task of looking after little children is a much deeper and more fundamental social issue than the phrases "babysitting" and "child care" suggest.

### Solution

In every neighborhood, build a children's home—a second home for children—a large rambling house or workplace—a place where children can stay for an hour or two, or for a week. At least one of the people who run it must live on the premises; it must be open 24 hours a day; open to children of all ages; and it must be clear, from the way that it is run, that it is a second family for the children—not just a place where baby-sitting is available.
