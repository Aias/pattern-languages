## Problem

The presence of children in a family often destroys the closeness and the special privacy which a couple needs together.

## Solution

Make a special part of the house distinct from the common areas and all the children's rooms, where the man and woman of the house can be together in private. Give this place a quick path to the children's rooms, but, at all costs, make it a distinctly separate realm.
