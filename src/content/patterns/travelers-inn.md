## Problem

A person who stays the night in a strange place is still a member of the human community, and still needs company. There is no reason why they should creep into a hole and watch TV alone, the way they do in a roadside motel.

## Solution

Make the traveler's inn a place where travelers can take rooms for the night, but where—unlike most hotels and motels—the inn draws all its energy from the community of travelers that are there any given evening. The scale is small—30 or 40 guests to an inn; meals are offers communally; there is even a large space ringed round with beds in alcoves.
