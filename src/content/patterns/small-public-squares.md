## Problem

A town needs public squares; they are the largest, most public, rooms that the town has. But when they are too large, they look and feel deserted.

## Solution

Make a public square much smaller than you would at first imagine; usually no more than 45 to 60 feet across, never more than 70 feet across. This applies only to its width in the short direction. In the long direction it can certainly be longer.
