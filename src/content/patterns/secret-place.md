## Problem

Where can the need for concealment be expressed; the need to hide; the need for something precious to be lost, and then revealed?

## Solution

Make a place in the house, perhaps only a few feet square, which is kept locked and secret; a place which is virtually impossible to discover—until you have been shown where it is; a place where the archives of the house, or other more potent secrets, might be kept.
