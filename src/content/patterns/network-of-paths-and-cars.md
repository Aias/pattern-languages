### Problem

Cars are dangerous to pedestrians; yet activities occur just where cars and pedestrians meet.

### Solution

Except where traffic densities are very high or very low, lay out pedestrian paths at right angles to roads, not along them, so that the paths gradually begin to form a second network, distinct from the road system, and orthogonal to it. This can be done quite gradually—even if you put in one path at a time, but always put them in the middle of the "block", so that they run across the roads.
