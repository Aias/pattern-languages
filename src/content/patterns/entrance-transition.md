### Problem

Buildings, and especially houses, with a graceful transition between the street and the inside, are more tranquil than those which open directly off the street.

### Solution

Make a transition space between the street and the front door. Bring the path which connects street and entrance through this transition space, and mark it with a change of light, a change of sound, a change of direction, a change of surface, a change of level, perhaps by gateways which make a change of enclosure, and above all with a change of view.
