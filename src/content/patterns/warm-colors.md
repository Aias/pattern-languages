### Problem

The greens and greys of hospitals and office corridors are depressing and cold. Natural wood, sunlight, bright colors are warm. In some way, the warmth of the colors in a room makes a great deal of difference between comfort and discomfort.

### Solution

Choose surface colors which, together with the color of the natural light, reflected light, and artificial lights, create a warm light in the rooms.
