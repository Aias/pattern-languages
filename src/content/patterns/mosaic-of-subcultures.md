## Problem

The homogeneous and undifferentiated character of modern cities kills all variety of life styles and arrests the growth of individual character.

## Solution

Do everything possible to enrich the cultures and subcultures of the city, by breaking the city, as far as possible, into a vast mosaic of small and different subcultures, each with its own spatial territory, and each with the power to create its own distinct lifestyle. Make sure that the subcultures are small enough, so that each person has access to the full variety of life styles in the subcultures near their own.
