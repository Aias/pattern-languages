## Problem

One of a window's most important functions is to put you in touch with the outdoors. If the sill is too high, it cuts you off.

## Solution

When determining exact location of windows also decide which windows should have low sills. On the first floor, make the sills of windows which you plan to sit by between 12 and 14 inches high. On the upper stories, make them higher, around 20 inches.
