### Problem

People cannot maintain their spiritual roots and their connections to the past if the physical world they live in does not also sustain these roots.

### Solution

Whether the sacred sites are large or small, whether they are at the center of the towns, in neighborhoods, or in the deepest countryside, establish ordinances which will protect them absolutely—so that our roots in the visible surroundings cannot be violated.
