### Problem

There are few cases in traditional architecture where builders have not used some roof detail to cap the building with an ornament.

### Solution

Choose a natural way to cap the roof—some way which is in keeping with the kind of construction, and the meaning of the building. The caps may be structural; but their main function is decorative—they mark the top—they mark the place where the roof penetrates the sky.
