### Problem

If a teenager's place in the home does not reflect their need for a measure of independence, they will be locked in conflict with their family.

### Solution

To mark a child's coming of age, transform their place in the home into a kind of cottage that expresses in a physical way the beginnings of independence. Keep the cottage attached to the home, but make it a distinctly visible bulge, far away from the master bedroom, with its own private entrance, perhaps its own roof.
