### Problem

You never know where pipes and conduits are; they are buried somewhere in the walls; but where exactly are they?

### Solution

Make ducts to carry hot air conduit, plumbing, gas, and other services in the triangular space, within the vault, around the upper edge of every room. Connect the ducts for different rooms by vertical ducts, in special chases, in the corners of rooms. Build outlets and panels at intervals along the duct for access to the conduits.
