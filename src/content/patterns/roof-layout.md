## Problem

What kind of roof plan is organically related to the nature of your building?

## Solution

Arrange the roofs so that each distinct roof corresponds to an identifiable social entity in the building or building complex. Place the largest roofs—those which are highest and have the largest span—over the largest and most important and most communal spaces; build the lesser roofs off these largest and highest roofs, in the form of half-vaults and sheds over alcoves and thick walls.
