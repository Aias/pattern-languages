### Problem

When trees are planted or pruned without regard for the special places they can create, they are as good as dead for the people who need them.

### Solution

If you are planting trees, plant them according to their nature, to form enclosures, avenues, squares, groves, and single spreading trees toward the middle of open spaces. And shape the nearby buildings in response to trees, so that the trees themselves, and the trees and buildings together, form places which people can use.
