### Problem

Windows are most often used to create connections between the indoor and the outdoors. But there are many cases when an indoor space needs a connecting window another indoor space.

### Solution

Put in fully glazed fixed windows between rooms which tend to be dead because they have too little action in them or where inside rooms are unusually dark.
