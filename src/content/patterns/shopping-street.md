### Problem

Shopping centers depend on access: they need locations near major traffic arteries. However, the shoppers themselves don't benefit from traffic: they need quiet, comfort, and convenience, and access from the pedestrian paths in the surrounding areas.

### Solution

Encourage local shopping centers to grow in the form of short pedestrian streets, at right angles to major roads and and opening off these roads—with parking behind the shops, so that the cars can pull directly off the road, and yet not harm the shopping street.
