## Problem

Rooms without a view are prisons for the people who have to stay in them.

## Solution

In each room, place the windows in such a way that their total area conforms roughly to the appropriate figures for your region (25 percent or more of floor area, in the San Francisco Bay Area), and place them in positions which give the best possible views out over life: activities in streets, quiet gardens, anything different from the indoor scene.
