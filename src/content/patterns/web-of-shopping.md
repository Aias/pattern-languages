### Problem

Shops rarely place themselves in those positions which best serve the people's needs, and also guarantee their own stability.

### Solution

When you locate any individual shop, follow a three-step procedure:

1. Identify all other shops which offer the service you are interested in; locate them on a map.
2. Identify and map the location of potential consumers. Wherever possible, indicate the density or total number of potential consumers in any given area.
3. Look for the biggest gap in the existing web of shops in those areas where there are potential consumers.
4. Within the gap in the web of similar shops, locate your shop next to the largest cluster of other kinds of shops.
