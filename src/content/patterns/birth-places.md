## Problem

It seems unlikely that any process which treats childbirth as a sickness could possibly be a healthy part of a healthy society.

## Solution

Build local birth places where women go to have their children: places that are specially tailored to childbirth as a natural, eventful moment—where the entire family comes for prenatal care and education; where fathers and midwives help during the hours of labor and birth.
