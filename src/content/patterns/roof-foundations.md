## Problem

The best foundations of all art the kinds of foundations which a tree has—where the entire structure of a tree simply continues below ground level, and creates a system entirely integral with the ground, in tension and compression.

## Solution

Try to find a way of making foundations in which the columns themselves go right into the earth, and spread out there—so that the footing is continuous with the material of the column, and the column, with its footing, like a tree root, can resist tension and horizontal shear as well as compression.
