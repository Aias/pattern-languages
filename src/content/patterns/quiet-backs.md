### Problem

Anyone who has to work in noise, in offices with people all around, needs to be able to pause and refresh themselves with quiet in a more natural situation.

### Solution

Give the buildings in the busy parts of town a quiet "back" behind them and away from the noise. Build a walk along this quiet back, far enough from the building so that it gets full sunlight, but protected from noise by walls and distance and buildings. Make certain that the path is not a natural shortcut for busy foot traffic, and connect it up with other walk, to form a long ribbon of quiet alleyways which converge on the local pools and streams and the local greens.
