## Problem

People need green open places to go to; when they are close they use them. But if the greens are more than three minutes away, the distance overwhelms the need.

## Solution

Build one open public green within three minutes' walk—about 750 feet—of every house and workplace. This means that the greens need to be uniformly scattered at 1,500-foot intervals, through the city. Make the greens at least 150 feet across, and at least 60,000 square feet in area.
