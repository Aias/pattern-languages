### Problem

The isolated kitchen, separate from the family and considered as an efficient but unpleasant factory fo food is a hangover from the days of servants; and from the more recent days when women willingly took over the servants' role.

### Solution

Make the kitchen bigger than usual, big enough to include the "family room" space, and place it near the center of the commons, not so far back in the house as an ordinary kitchen. Make it large enough to hold a good big table and chairs, some soft and some hard, with counters and stove and sink around the edge of the room; and make it a bright and comfortable room.
