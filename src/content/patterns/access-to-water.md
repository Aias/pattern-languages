### Problem

People have a fundamental yearning for great bodies of water. But the very movement of the people toward the water can also destroy the water.

### Solution

When natural bodies of water occur near human settlements, treat them with great respect. Always preserve a belt of common land, immediately beside the water. And allow dense settlements to come right down to the water only at infrequent intervals along the water's edge.
