### Problem

Teenage is the time of passage between childhood and adulthood. In traditional societies, this passage is accompanies by rites which suit the psychological demands of the transition. But in modern society the "high school" fails entirely to provide this passage.

### Solution

Replace the "high school" with an institution which is actually a model of adult society, in which the students take on most of the responsibility for learning and social life, with clearly defined roles and forms of discipline. Provide adult guidance, both for the learning, and the social structure of society; but keep them as far as feasible, in the hands of the students.
