### Problem

There are very few spots along the streets of modern towns and neighborhoods where people can hang out, comfortable, for hours at a time.

### Solution

In every neighborhood and work community, make a piece of the common land into an outdoor room—a partly enclosed place, with some roof, columns, without walls, perhaps with a trellis; place it beside an important path and within view of many homes and workshops.
