## Problem

Each subculture needs a center for its public life: a place where you can go to see people, and to be seen.

## Solution

Encourage the gradual formation of a promenade at the heart of every community, linking the main activity nodes, and placed centrally, so that each point in the community is within 10 minutes' walk of it. Put main points of attraction at the two ends, to keep a constant movement up and down.
