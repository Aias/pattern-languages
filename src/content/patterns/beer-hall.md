## Problem

Where can people sing, and drink, and shout, and let go of their sorrows?

## Solution

Somewhere in the community at least one big place where a few hundred people can gather, with beer and wine, music, and perhaps a half-dozen activities, so that people are continually cross-crossing from one to another.
