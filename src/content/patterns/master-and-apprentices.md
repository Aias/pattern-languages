## Problem

The fundamental learning situation is one in which a person learns by helping someone who really knows what they are doing.

## Solution

Arrange the work in every workgroup, industry, and office, in such a way that work and learning go forward hand in hand. Treat every piece of work as an opportunity for learning. To this end, organize work around a tradition of masters and apprentices: and support this form of social organization with a division of the workspace into spatial clusters—one for each master and their apprentices—where the group can work and meet together.
